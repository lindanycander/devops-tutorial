# Conclusion

After completing the executable part of this tutorial, we hope that you have learned something new. We list the intended learning outcomes here below and connect them to what we have done in this tutorial.

### 1. How to train a simple ML model on the Iris dataset. ✅

In this tutorial, we showed which code we used for training the model. You ran the training code to get the new predictions.

### 2. How to deploy the model using FastAPI and Uvicorn. ✅

In this tutorial, you wrote the commands for deploying the model using FastAPI and Uvicorn so hopefully you now know how it works.

### 3. How to interact with the model via HTTP requests (curl). ✅

In this tutorial, you wrote commands for checking the connection to the model.

### 4. How deployment makes ML models usable and reliable in practice. ✅

In this tutorial, you used the model for getting new predictions, after you successfully deployed it.

### 5. (BONUS: How to find an easter egg in this environment) ✅❔

Hopefully, you also found the easter egg. If not, you can now check it out with the command `curl http://localhost:8000/easter-egg`.
