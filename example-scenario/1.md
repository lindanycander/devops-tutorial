# Setting up venv

Before we can do anything, we need to set up the Python virtual environment (venv) so that we can install dependencies using `pip`.

1. Create a new directory with `mkdir iris`, then navigate into the directory with `cd iris` (The dir can in theory be named anything, but we'll stick to naming it `iris` for consistency).
2. Run `python3 -m venv .` to create a venv in that repository.
3. Run `source ./bin/activate` to activate the venv.
4. Run `which pip` to verify that the `pip` binary we are executing is inside the venv we just created: You should see `/root/iris/bin/pip` in the terminal output.
